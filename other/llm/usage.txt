What are some unit tests and edge cases I could consider for this dataset:
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  id = sample(10000:99999, n, replace = FALSE),
  zip_code = sample(98101:98140, n, replace = TRUE),
  beds = sample(c(0:5), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05)),
  baths = sample(c(1:4), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2)),
  sqft = round(rnorm(n, 900, 100))
) 

simulated_data <- simulated_data |>
  mutate(price = round(sqft * rpois(n, 700), -3))

When testing this dataset, consider the following unit tests and edge cases to ensure the data behaves as expected:

Unit Tests
Data Type Validation

Ensure all columns have the correct data type (id as integer, zip_code as integer, beds and baths as integers, sqft as numeric, and price as numeric).
Range Tests

Verify that id values are within 10000 and 99999.
Confirm zip_code values are within 98101 and 98140.
Check beds values range from 0 to 5 and baths values range from 1 to 4.
Validate that sqft values are within reasonable bounds, e.g., no negative or excessively large values.
Probability Distribution Check

Confirm that beds and baths distributions match the given probabilities.
Price Calculation

Verify that price is always sqft * rpois(n, 700) rounded to the nearest thousand.
Edge Cases
Minimum and Maximum Values

Verify rows where beds = 0 and baths = 1, as these could represent unusual properties.
Check the highest and lowest price values to ensure no extreme outliers or calculation errors.
Negative or Unusual sqft

Test with very low sqft values (near zero) or exceedingly high values (e.g., mean + 5 * SD) to see if price is calculated correctly.
ID Collision

Test the uniqueness of id values when n approaches the range size (e.g., n = 89999).
Probability Extremes

Test with edge probability settings (e.g., all properties have beds = 0 or baths = 4) to ensure logic handles skewed distributions.
Invalid Inputs

Check behavior when n = 0 or n is extremely large (e.g., n > 100,000).
Testing these will ensure the dataset generation logic and resulting data meet expectations.

How do I access a zip file with boundaries (geojson, shp, etc.) and plot it

--- ChatGPT ---
To access a ZIP file containing boundary data like GeoJSON, Shapefiles (SHP), or other formats, you can use the sf package in R to unzip, read, and plot the spatial data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Example: Plotting from a ZIP File
1. Download and unzip the file
R
Copy code
# Install required package
install.packages("sf")

# Load the library
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

# Example: Path to ZIP file
zip_url <- "https://example.com/boundaries.zip"  # Replace with actual URL or file path
zip_file <- "boundaries.zip"

# Download the file if online
download.file(zip_url, destfile = zip_file)

# Unzip the file
unzip(zip_file, exdir = "boundaries")  # Extract to a folder called "boundaries"

# List the files to identify the GeoJSON, SHP, etc.
list.files("boundaries")
2. Read the boundary file
Use sf to read the appropriate file format:

Shapefiles: .shp
GeoJSON: .geojson or .json
R
Copy code
# Read shapefile or GeoJSON (adjust file path as needed)
boundary_data <- st_read("boundaries/your_file_name.shp")  # Replace with actual file name

# For GeoJSON
# boundary_data <- st_read("boundaries/your_file_name.geojson")
3. Plot the data
R
Copy code
# Plot the spatial data using ggplot2
ggplot(data = boundary_data) +
  geom_sf(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boundary Map", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  theme_minimal()
Key Steps:
Unzip: Use unzip() to extract files from the ZIP archive.
Read Spatial Data: Use st_read() from sf to load the data. It automatically detects the file format.
Plot: Use geom_sf() with ggplot2 to visualize the boundaries.
Notes:
Ensure the ZIP file contains the required files for Shapefiles (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.).
If working with large files, set quiet = FALSE in st_read() to monitor progress.
For GeoJSON, no additional files are needed beyond the .geojson.
