What are some unit tests and edge cases I could consider for this dataset:
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  id = sample(10000:99999, n, replace = FALSE),
  zip_code = sample(98101:98140, n, replace = TRUE),
  beds = sample(c(0:5), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05)),
  baths = sample(c(1:4), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2)),
  sqft = round(rnorm(n, 900, 100))
) 

simulated_data <- simulated_data |>
  mutate(price = round(sqft * rpois(n, 700), -3))

When testing this dataset, consider the following unit tests and edge cases to ensure the data behaves as expected:

Unit Tests
Data Type Validation

Ensure all columns have the correct data type (id as integer, zip_code as integer, beds and baths as integers, sqft as numeric, and price as numeric).
Range Tests

Verify that id values are within 10000 and 99999.
Confirm zip_code values are within 98101 and 98140.
Check beds values range from 0 to 5 and baths values range from 1 to 4.
Validate that sqft values are within reasonable bounds, e.g., no negative or excessively large values.
Probability Distribution Check

Confirm that beds and baths distributions match the given probabilities.
Price Calculation

Verify that price is always sqft * rpois(n, 700) rounded to the nearest thousand.
Edge Cases
Minimum and Maximum Values

Verify rows where beds = 0 and baths = 1, as these could represent unusual properties.
Check the highest and lowest price values to ensure no extreme outliers or calculation errors.
Negative or Unusual sqft

Test with very low sqft values (near zero) or exceedingly high values (e.g., mean + 5 * SD) to see if price is calculated correctly.
ID Collision

Test the uniqueness of id values when n approaches the range size (e.g., n = 89999).
Probability Extremes

Test with edge probability settings (e.g., all properties have beds = 0 or baths = 4) to ensure logic handles skewed distributions.
Invalid Inputs

Check behavior when n = 0 or n is extremely large (e.g., n > 100,000).
Testing these will ensure the dataset generation logic and resulting data meet expectations.

How do I access a zip file with boundaries (geojson, shp, etc.) and plot it

--- ChatGPT ---
To access a ZIP file containing boundary data like GeoJSON, Shapefiles (SHP), or other formats, you can use the sf package in R to unzip, read, and plot the spatial data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Example: Plotting from a ZIP File
1. Download and unzip the file
R
Copy code
# Install required package
install.packages("sf")

# Load the library
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

# Example: Path to ZIP file
zip_url <- "https://example.com/boundaries.zip"  # Replace with actual URL or file path
zip_file <- "boundaries.zip"

# Download the file if online
download.file(zip_url, destfile = zip_file)

# Unzip the file
unzip(zip_file, exdir = "boundaries")  # Extract to a folder called "boundaries"

# List the files to identify the GeoJSON, SHP, etc.
list.files("boundaries")
2. Read the boundary file
Use sf to read the appropriate file format:

Shapefiles: .shp
GeoJSON: .geojson or .json
R
Copy code
# Read shapefile or GeoJSON (adjust file path as needed)
boundary_data <- st_read("boundaries/your_file_name.shp")  # Replace with actual file name

# For GeoJSON
# boundary_data <- st_read("boundaries/your_file_name.geojson")
3. Plot the data
R
Copy code
# Plot the spatial data using ggplot2
ggplot(data = boundary_data) +
  geom_sf(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boundary Map", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  theme_minimal()
Key Steps:
Unzip: Use unzip() to extract files from the ZIP archive.
Read Spatial Data: Use st_read() from sf to load the data. It automatically detects the file format.
Plot: Use geom_sf() with ggplot2 to visualize the boundaries.
Notes:
Ensure the ZIP file contains the required files for Shapefiles (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.).
If working with large files, set quiet = FALSE in st_read() to monitor progress.
For GeoJSON, no additional files are needed beyond the .geojson.
Let me know if you'd like a full example with real-world data!

What is wrong with this chunk, and is there an alternative i can take:
cleaned_data <- raw_data |>
  clean_names() |>
  select(sale_type, mls_number, property_type, city, zip_or_postal_code, beds, 
         baths, location, square_feet, year_built, days_on_market, hoa_month,
         price, latitude, longitude) |>
  filter(sale_type != "New Construction Plan",
         !is.na(square_feet),
         year_built <= 2024) |>
  rename(mls_id = mls_number,
         zip_code = zip_or_postal_code,
         neighbourhood = location,
         sqft = square_feet) |>
  mutate(hoa_month = replace_na(hoa_month, 0),
         half_bath = ifelse(baths - floor(baths) > 0, 1, 0),
         baths = floor(baths),
         property_age = 2024 - year_built,
         price_sqft = round(price / sqft, 2),
         property_type = recode(property_type, "Single Family Residential" = "Single Family"))

--- ChatGPT ---
The provided R code chunk is performing data cleaning and transformation using a pipeline (|> operator) common in tidyverse workflows. Below are some issues or considerations, and potential alternatives:

Issues in the Code
Hardcoding the year 2024:

Using a hardcoded year (year_built <= 2024 and 2024 - year_built) limits the code's reusability in future years. It's better to calculate the current year dynamically.
Assumption in half_bath logic:

The logic baths - floor(baths) > 0 assumes that fractional bath numbers always indicate a half bath. This may not align with real-world data (e.g., "1.75 baths").
price_sqft calculation:

Division by zero or missing values in sqft could lead to errors or warnings, even though you've filtered out NA values earlier.
mutate overwriting baths:

Modifying the baths column directly after deriving half_bath might confuse downstream analysis. Consider retaining the original column or clarifying its intent.
Recode of property_type:

The recode function assumes no other unexpected values are present in property_type, which may cause warnings or errors if additional property types exist.
location renamed to neighbourhood:

If the location column contains broader information (e.g., coordinates, not just neighborhood names), the renaming might misrepresent the data.
Suggested Alternatives and Improvements
Here’s a more robust and dynamic version of the code:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

current_year <- as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))

cleaned_data <- raw_data %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(
    sale_type, mls_number, property_type, city, zip_or_postal_code, beds, 
    baths, location, square_feet, year_built, days_on_market, hoa_month,
    price, latitude, longitude
  ) %>%
  filter(
    sale_type != "New Construction Plan",
    !is.na(square_feet),
    year_built <= current_year
  ) %>%
  rename(
    mls_id = mls_number,
    zip_code = zip_or_postal_code,
    neighbourhood = location,
    sqft = square_feet
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    hoa_month = replace_na(hoa_month, 0),
    half_bath = if_else((baths %% 1) > 0, 1, 0),  # More robust logic
    baths_full = floor(baths),  # Avoid overwriting original baths
    property_age = current_year - year_built,
    price_sqft = if_else(sqft > 0, round(price / sqft, 2), NA_real_), # Handle zero sqft
    property_type = recode(
      property_type,
      "Single Family Residential" = "Single Family",
      .default = "Other" # Default for unexpected values
    )
  )
Key Changes Explained
Dynamic current_year:

Replaced 2024 with current_year calculated using Sys.Date().
Improved half_bath logic:

Used (baths %% 1) to check for fractional parts, ensuring robustness.
Retained original baths as baths_full for clarity.
Guarded price_sqft:

Used if_else to ensure price_sqft isn’t calculated when sqft is zero or missing.
Default in recode:

Added .default to handle unexpected property_type values.
Column renaming clarified:

Kept baths and baths_full separate to avoid confusion in transformations.
By implementing these changes, your code will be more robust, future-proof, and adaptable for varied datasets.
